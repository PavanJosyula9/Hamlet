{Scene 1} 

Synopsis: 
On the guards' platform at Elsinore, Horatio waits with Barnardo and Marcellus to question a ghost that has twice before appeared. The Ghost, in the form of the late King Hamlet of Denmark, appears but will not speak. Horatio decides to tell his fellow student, Prince Hamlet, about the Ghost's appearance. 

Enter Bernardo and Francisco, two sentinels. 

BARNARDO: Who's there? 
FRANCISO: Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself. 
BARNARDO: Long live the King!
FRANCISO: Barnardo? 
BARNARDO: He. 
FRANCISCO: You come most carefully upon your hour. 
BARNARDO: 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
